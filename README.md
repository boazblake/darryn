This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged frontend application built with **[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


You can view a live demo over at [realworld-mithril.com](https://boazblake.github.io/realworld-mithril/)
